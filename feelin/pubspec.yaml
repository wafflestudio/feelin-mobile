  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom font to your application, add a font section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "font" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # font:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     font:
  #       - asset: font/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: font/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     font:
  #       - asset: font/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: font/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding font from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
